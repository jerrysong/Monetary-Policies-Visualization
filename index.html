                                Historically, the Federal Reserve primarily acted by changing interest rates, but after slashing the interest rate to near 0% in late 2008, the Federal Reserve decided that it was time for a more drastic measure: Quantitative Easing (QE). The Fed starting
                                buying tens of billions of mortgage backed securities. When the first round didn’t produce satisfactory long-term results, the Fed tried two more rounds.

                                    One of the reasons the Federal Reserve went to such drastic measures was in hopes of stabilizing flailing financial markets in a manner that would create a “wealth effect”, where increasing financials markets lead to higher consumer confidence, which
                                    leads to more spending. This concept of a “wealth effect” is a similar to the “trickle-down theory”, where giving money to people who are well off leads to more investment than ends up helping everyone.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-muted">
                                    Certainly, the combination of “easy money” policies (such as QE and dropping the interest rate to 0%) helped the stock market recover from its Great Recession lows. However, it’s questionable whether that was fully positive. After all, shouldn’t increase
                                    in stock prices be driven by actual economic fundamentals?

                            <p class="text-muted">So, while the actions of the Federal Reserve drove stock and bond markets for two years, how well did their actions fulfill the Fed mandates of balancing inflation and unemployment? And what do those mandates really mean in
                                practice? Effectively, the Fed works to ensure that prices aren’t rising too quickly (i.e. inflation) and that money is spread out in a healthy manner through society (unemployment rate and wage levels). </p>

                            <p class="text-muted">How well did Quantitative Easing help the Federal Reserve meet its mandates? The Fed's stated goals are 5% unemployment and 2% inflation, which they are close to. Of course, their inflation metric ignores housing costs in a
                                time when affordable housing crises are prevalent in many major cities and their unemployment metric counts someone working 1 hour a week as fully employed; taking in underemployment, the unemployment rate jumps up to 8.6%.
                                Additionally, studies have shown that since 2007, about an additional 1% of the adult population who want a job stopped looking for work (See Summary for more information on Labor Participation Rates).</p>

                            <p class="text-muted">These metrics may not really provide a wholly accurate picture about how people are faring. However, we can look at how income for a variety of Americans has changed in comparison to changes in costs. This will allow us to
                                see the financial status of many Americans has evolved post Great-Recession.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted">The Federal Reserve took drastic measures after the Great Recession in hopes of stimulating the economy. They purchased $3.5 trillion in financial products over several years. The Fed's actions helped the stock market recover
                            and reach new heights, but didn't help bring that same prosperity to most Americans. In fact, Americans with the lowest income are in many regards still recovering from the Great Recession. Looking forward, the Federal Reserve
                            is looking to start slowly unwinding their balance sheet. This could effectively reverse some of the effects on the Stock Market caused by Quantative Easing. However, the Fed is concerned that inflation does not seem to be
                            picking up, and therefore may hold off on their unwinding.</p>
